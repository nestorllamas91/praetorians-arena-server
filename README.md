# Praetorians Arena

Praetorians Arena is an online competition platform for the videogame "Praetorians - HD Remaster". This is a remaster, released in 2020, for the original videogame "Praetorians", released in 2003. The videogame is available for the videogame platforms PC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, but this competitions platform is only available for PC (Microsoft Windows) since the sequence files of the played games cannot be uploaded with the consoles.

The goal of the platform is to achieve the first position in the rankings of the available competitions by playing and uploading the sequence files of the played games into this platform. The rankings are automatically updated with the internal data of such sequence files. A sequence file is just a type of binary file that is saved by a player after finishing a multiplayer game, and it is the proof that Praetorians Arena is based on.

The platform has 4 quarterly seasons per year, starting on the 1st of January and ending on the 31st of December. Each season is composed by several competitions. So there will be rankings depending on season and competition. While the pre-designed base system is considered already fixed, small variations may arise between seasons, but never throughout a same season.

Praetorians Arena is a fan-generated platform not supported by Kalypso Media Group (the publisher of the videogame), meaning that this is an unofficial platform. Moreover, as Kalypso Media Group does not allow commercial use with their products for unofficial platforms, this website is completely non-commercial: no payments, no donations, no ads, no prizes.

# Praetorians - HD Remaster

Praetorians is a real-time strategy videogame, originally released in 2003 only for the videogame platform PC (Microsoft Windows), but remastered in 2020 for PC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The developer of "Praetorians" was Pyro Studios and the developer of "Praetorians - HD Remaster" is Torus Games. In both cases, the publisher is Kalypso Media Group. The title of the videogame refers to the elite Roman guard, the praetorians.

Praetorians focuses on Julius Caesar's campaigns on a period of time when Rome was constantly at war. It was easy for them. They were rich and had an amanzingly disciplined army with extremely capable commanders and good weapons and armor. During this period of Roman expansion, the legions were unbeatable, and were used with impunity in battles across Northern Europe and Britannia, the Near East, and North Africa. As expected, being so widespread was part of the reason why the great Roman Empire finally fell, but it was a fantastic journey while it lasted.

Praetorians is set in the middle of the political frameworks of an emerging Roman Empire. You will be transported back to the combat theaters of Gaul, the dusty battlefields of Egypt, and finally to the heart of the Empire itself, Italy, in the crusade to become Emperor. Your journey will not be easy, as the Empire is heavily defended by thousands of different troop types and war machines, all with special skills and individual strengths. The road to become Emperor depends on strategy! You must learn to combine your units and exploit the weakness of the enemy, but as you get closer to the Emperor things become even more difficult, since you must face his personal guard, the most powerful and deadly fighting force in the Empire: the Praetorian Guard!
